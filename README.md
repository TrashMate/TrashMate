### 1. Inspiration

The inspiration of TrashMate was drawn from the Life of
"Nek Chand Ji", one who made the entire "Rock Garden" of
"Chandigarh". He dedicated whole of his life to make
world clean by reusing the Trash.

### 2. What it does ?

Our primarily goal is "Invest Trash, Harvest Love". So,
to achieve our goal we made a medium which is TrashMate
. Basically, this is like a social media platform, where
the users can interact with people of similar interest.
In TrashMate, users can provide trash to those creative
minds which can make a worth out of it. TrashMate is
just a gateway between Trash Givers and Treasure Makers.

### 3. How we built it

                    Learn-Try-Improve

### 4. Challenges we ran into

Being novel to these kind of tasks, coming up with the
idea, our team came across various challenges including
GUI, implementation of Google Login etc.

### 5. Accomplishments that we are proud of

                    We learnt a lot

### 6. What we learnt

Trash of someone could be treasure of other one. We just
need to connect both the users via some kind of gateway,
here TrashMate does the job.

### 7. What's next for this

With TrashMate, our team aims to convert Trash into
Treasure. Our team seeks to expand it beyond limits.
